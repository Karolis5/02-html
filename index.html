    <h1>Justice Department has issued dozens of subpoenas in the last week related to Trump and the Capitol riot</h1>
    <h2> The show's creator, Hwang Dong-hyuk, won the best drama series director prize, also the first Asian to do so.

        Ted Lasso won best comedy series for the second year in a row, while outstanding drama went to Succession, also for a second year running.
        
        The drama's British creator Jesse Armstrong made a jibe about the monarchy during his acceptance speech at the US TV industry's most prestigious ceremony of the year.
        
        "It's a big week for successions - new King in the UK, this for us," he joked. "Evidently a bit more voting involved in our winning than Prince Charles."</h2>
    
    The subpoenas and phone seizures, first reported by The New York Times, are the latest developments in the sprawling investigation into the former president.
